# Classification-CreditDefault
The dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit
"Banks play a crucial role in market economies. They decide who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit. Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted."
In this task, we will build classifiers to predict if someone will experience financial distress and therefore cannot pay off credit card (i.e. default). It is a binary classificaiton problem: default (class-1) or not default (class-0)
